Hello my name is Filipp and this is my second project for roadmap.sh.
This project contains adding expenses, update them, delete them, view them.
Also view all summary of all expenses and for a specific month.
At the top your expenses are going to be saved locally in the file called {expenses.cvs}.
So give a like on roadmap.sh.
